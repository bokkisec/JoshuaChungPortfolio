            <h1><u>Python Experience</u></h1>
            <p>
                Python is the language I use whenever I want to solve some problem programmatically. For example, I learned how to use
                Python to programmatically download mp3 files from a Youtube playlist using Google's API and parsing json files.
                I also like to write pseudocode in a mix of Python and English because it is easy to read.

            <h2>Code In Place 2021</h2>
            <p>
                This was a free online intro to Python course hosted by Stanford University from April to May in 2021. It was a great experience because
                help was always available via an Ed Discussion board. For my final project, I created an automatic sudoku solver using a recursive backtracking
                algorithm.

            <h2>LeetCode</h2>
            <p>
                Python is the language I have been using to practice my data structures and algorithms on the website LeetCode.

            <h2>Birthday Monkey (Discord Bot)</h2>
            <p>
                As a personal side project, I built a discord bot which allows users to keep track of a list of birthdays.
                The list is stored locally using a Python library called Pickle, which serializes Python data structures
                such as dictionaries.
